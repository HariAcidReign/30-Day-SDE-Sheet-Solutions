# Striver SDE Sheet Solutions (C++)
This is everything you need to ace your coding interviews! 

## 🎯 Purpose
After the huge success of my [**Javascript A-Z Notes repository**](https://github.com/HariAcidReign/JavaScript-A-Z-Notes), I had been toying with the idea to make a repo for all the questions in the SDE Sheet. This might be of massive help especially if you are preparing for placements and want a quick revision of the problems before your OA or interviews 🔥 (Almost) All the questions have 2 ways of solving (mine and my friend's) + **every answer has detailed comments for every step** 

I myself used the **SDE Sheet** extensively and was able to bag an offer for 6 months (Jan-Jun) internship at **Amazon** and became one of the 8 people to get selected for this on-campus opportunity from over a 1000 candidates!🥳 So, here is my way of saying *thank you!* to take4forward and the TUF fam 🤎

## 🥂 Who created this?
This is a painstaking effort of both **mine** and my very good friend + coding buddy [**Siddharth**](https://github.com/DiligentCoder-20022001). Go checkout our other awesome repos!

## 💗 Contributions
I'll always work on my DSA skills, so expect this repo to get updated constantly. Time and space complexities haven't been added for most questions, so if you want to start your open-source journey from here, you are most welcome to! Also, if you have a better (and tested) implementation for any problem, feel free to add. I review PRs frequently 🤓
