## üéØ Purpose
After the huge success of my [**Javascript A-Z Notes repository**](https://github.com/HariAcidReign/JavaScript-A-Z-Notes), I had been toying with the idea to make a repo for all the questions in the SDE Sheet. This might be of massive help especially if you are preparing for placements and want a quick revision of the problems before your OA or interviews üî• (Almost) All the questions have 2 ways of solving (mine and my friend's) + **every answer has detailed comments for every step** 

I myself used the **SDE Sheet** extensively and was able to bag an offer for 6 months (Jan-Jun) internship at **Amazon** and became one of the 8 people to get selected for this on-campus opportunity from over a 1000 candidates!ü•≥ So, here is my way of saying *thank you!* to takeUforward and the TUF fam ü§é

## ü•Ç Who created this?
This is a painstaking effort of both **mine** and my very good friend + coding buddy [**Siddharth**](https://github.com/DiligentCoder-20022001). Go checkout our other awesome repos!

## üíó Contributions
I'll always work on my DSA skills, so expect this repo to get updated constantly. 
- Time and space complexities haven't been added for some questions, so if you want to start your open-source journey from here, you are most welcome to! 
- Also, if you have a better (and tested) implementation for any problem, feel free to add. I review PRs frequently ü§ì
